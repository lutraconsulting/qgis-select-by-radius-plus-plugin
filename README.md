# Select By Radius +

![icon](https://github.com/lutraconsulting/qgis-select-by-radius-plus-plugin/blob/master/resources/icon.svg)

This plugin extends the capability of the current selection tool by radius.

Using this plugin, user can:
- Set the distance for radius
- Set the unit in m, km and miles (don't ask us why people still use miles)

You can then click on the canvas to define the centre of the circle. If you have enabled **Snapping Options** for your layers, the centre point will follow your snap settings.
